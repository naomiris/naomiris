 "Hello World! 🌎" 
  That's how my story began in the IT world, it's been a wonderful journey with it's up and downs as it should be.
  Now I can say that I'm ready to take the next step. I'm currently seeking for my first job as a Full Stack Developer or Front End Developer as it's the field that I feel 
  more confortable and ready to demostrate my habilities. But I'm open to any oportunity as I'm capable of adapting and to futher learn whatever technology is required for     the position you can offer me. If you are interested in my profile don't doubt for a second an contact me📪
